# ShooterWithECS
This is a little shooter game on Unity using the new ECS paradigm.
There is not much yet, as I'm doing this game to learn ECS.

The graphic assets I'm using for the ships are not shared here, as they are
part of a paid asset on the store. So if you want them, you can find them [here](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vehicles/space/modular-spaceships-collection-81341).

## What is done

- Player ship movement
- Player ship shooting
- Bullet spawning and cleanup
